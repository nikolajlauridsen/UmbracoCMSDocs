# Upgrades in general

_This is the guide for upgrading in general._

:::warning
**Important**: If you are upgrading to a new major version, like from Umbraco 8 to Umbraco 9, make sure to check out the **[version-specific documentation.](version-specific.md)**

Things may go wrong for various reasons. Make sure to **ALWAYS** make a backup of both your site's files and the database so that you can return to a version that you know works. You will need the backed up files for merging later so this step is not optional.

Before upgrading to a new major version, check if the packages you're using are compatible with the version you're upgrading to. On the package's download page, in the **Project compatibility** area, click **View details** to check version-specific compatibility.
:::

Sometimes there are exceptions to these guidelines, which are listed in the **[version-specific guide](version-specific.md)**.

## Note

It is necessary to run the upgrade installer on each environment of your Umbraco site. So if you want to update your staging and your live site then you need to repeat the steps below and make sure that you click through the install screens so that your upgrade is complete.

## Contents

In this article you will find instruction of 3 different ways of upgrading:

* [Upgrade using NuGet](#upgrade-using-nuget)
* [Upgrade manually from a Zip file](#upgrade-manually-from-a-zip-file)
* [Run an unattended upgrade](#run-an-unattended-upgrade)

## Upgrade using NuGet

NuGet installs the latest version of the package when you use the `dotnet add package` command unless you specify a package version:  

`dotnet add package Umbraco.Cms --version <VERSION>`

After you have added a package reference to your project by executing the `dotnet add package Umbraco.Cms` command in the directory that contains your project file, run `dotnet restore` to install the package.

When the command completes, open the **.csproj** file to make sure the package reference was updated: 

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Umbraco.Cms" Version="9.0.1" />
</ItemGroup>
```
